To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def printhi(name):
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
printhi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

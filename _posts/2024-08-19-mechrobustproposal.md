## Introduction

AI systems are rapidly growing more general <d-cite key="bubeck_sparks_2023"></d-cite> and capable <d-cite key="bengio_managing_2023"></d-cite>, raising concerns about potential catastrophic risks <d-cite key="hendrycks_overview_2023,hendrycks_xrisk_2022"></d-cite> from future advanced systems. Beyond these long-term *existential* concerns, as AI systems integrate into critical domains in the near-term -- like energy <d-cite key="raza_review_2015"></d-cite>, finance <d-cite key="bahoo_artificial_2024"></d-cite>, healthcare <d-cite key="yu_artificial_2018"></d-cite>, transportation <d-cite key="fagnant_preparing_2015"></d-cite>, cybersecurity <d-cite key="taddeo_trusting_2019"></d-cite> and military <d-cite key="horowitz_artificial_2018"></d-cite>, and telecommunications <d-cite key="chen_artificial_2019"></d-cite> -- ensuring their safety is crucial *now*.

Safe AI needs to be robust -- to withstand distribution shifts, rare ("black swan") events, and adversarial attacks <d-cite key="hendrycks_unsolved_2022"></d-cite>. While broader robustness against perceptible <d-cite key="poursaeed_robustness_2021"></d-cite> or unforeseen <d-cite key="kaufmann_testing_2023"></d-cite> attacks remains nascent, even the limited $l_p$-type adversarial robustness in vision (small perturbations of inputs subject to a small p-norm constraint) <d-cite key="huang_survey_2020"></d-cite> and language models (restricted to limited tokens for language models) <d-cite key="shayegani_survey_2023"></d-cite> is unsolved and the mechanisms of these vulnerabilities are poorly understood.

Adversarial robustness can serve as a testbed and proxy for broader safety challenges: *If we can't defend against small, crafted perturbations, we're unlikely to solve more complex safety issues.* Despite extensive research, we lack a comprehensive understanding of AI vulnerabilities <d-cite key="garcia-carrasco_detecting_2024,sadria_adversarial_2023"></d-cite>. Competing theories explain adversarial examples: non-robust features <d-cite key="ilyas_adversarial_2019"></d-cite>, feature superposition <d-cite key="elhage_toy_2022"></d-cite>, decision boundary tilting <d-cite key="gilmer_adversarial_2018"></d-cite>, insufficient regularization <d-cite key="goodfellow_explaining_2015"></d-cite>, and neural tangent kernel perspectives <d-cite key="tsilivis_what_2022"></d-cite>. Each offers insights, but a unified understanding remains elusive.

Interpretability, the interdisciplinary effort to understand AI systems <d-cite key="miller_explanation_2019,molnar_interpretable_2022"></d-cite>, is critical for AI safety <d-cite key="doshi-velez_rigorous_2017,hendrycks_introduction_2023"></d-cite>. It encompasses a spectrum of approaches, from feature attribution methods <d-cite key="smilkov_smoothgrad_2017,sundararajan_axiomatic_2017"></d-cite> to concept-based explanations <d-cite key="belinkov_probing_2021,zou_representation_2023"></d-cite>. Recent research reveals intriguing connections between interpretability and adversarial robustness <d-cite key="rauker_transparent_2023,casper_engineer_2023"></d-cite>. Adversarially trained models often exhibit improved interpretability <d-cite key="engstrom_adversarial_2019"></d-cite>, while more interpretable models tend to be more robust <d-cite key="jyoti_robustness_2022"></d-cite>. This symbiosis suggests that advances in one area could yield benefits in the other, potentially leading to AI systems that are both more transparent and secure <d-cite key="augustin_adversarial_2020,ortiz-jimenez_optimism_2021"></d-cite>.

Mechanistic interpretability, a novel *bottom-up* approach, aims to reverse-engineer neural networks' computational mechanisms <d-cite key="bereska_mechanistic_2024,olah_zoom_2020"></d-cite>. By treating networks as computational graphs, it seeks to uncover *circuits* responsible for specific behaviors <d-cite key="cammarata_curve_2020,olsson_incontext_2022"></d-cite>. This approach offers a path to understanding AI's internal cognition at a granular level, potentially revealing how adversarial vulnerabilities arise and propagate through networks <d-cite key="garcia-carrasco_detecting_2024"></d-cite>. Techniques such as activation patching <d-cite key="meng_locating_2022,geiger_inducing_2021,vig_investigating_2020"></d-cite> and circuit analysis <d-cite key="wang_interpretability_2023"></d-cite> provide powerful tools for dissecting model behavior. However, challenges remain in scaling these methods to large language models <d-cite key="zimmermann_scale_2023"></d-cite> and ensuring their reliability in the face of potential "interpretability illusions" <d-cite key="bolukbasi_interpretability_2021"></d-cite>. Despite these hurdles, mechanistic interpretability shows promise in bridging the gap between theoretical understanding of model behavior and practical techniques for enhancing robustness and safety <d-cite key="casper_engineer_2023,hubinger_overview_2020"></d-cite>.

We argue that the intersection of adversarial robustness and mechanistic interpretability could significantly advance AI safety research. This proposal explores synergies between these fields to develop safer AI systems, structured as follows: We review theories of adversarial vulnerability ([Section 2.1](#theories-of-adversarial-vulnerability)), examine connections between robustness and interpretability ([Section 2.2](#connections-between-robustness-and-interpretability)), overview mechanistic interpretability concepts and techniques ([Section 2.3](#fundamentals-of-mechanistic-interpretability)), identify key open questions and future directions ([Section 2.4](#open-questions-and-future-directions)). Based on this foundation, we propose a research agenda ([Section 3](#research-objectives-and-methodology)), outline experiments ([Sections 4](#proposed-experiments)), and finally, consider potential impacts and ethical considerations ([Section 5](#potential-impacts-and-ethical-considerations)). By pursuing this agenda, we aim to contribute to the development of powerful, transparent, and reliable AI systems aligned with human values, advancing AI safety as capabilities continue to grow rapidly.

## Background

### Theories of Adversarial Vulnerability 

Despite extensive research, the underlying causes of adversarial vulnerability in neural networks remain contested. Several theories attempt to explain this phenomenon, each offering unique insights and implications for interpretability:

**Non-robust features hypothesis.** Proposed by <d-cite key="ilyas_adversarial_2019"></d-cite>, this theory argues that adversarial examples exploit highly predictive but imperceptible features in the data. It is supported by the ability of models trained on adversarially perturbed datasets to generalize to clean data and the transferability of adversarial examples between models <d-cite key="liu_delving_2017"></d-cite>. However, precisely characterizing these non-robust features remains challenging.

**Superposition hypothesis.** In contrast, <d-cite key="elhage_toy_2022"></d-cite> link adversarial vulnerability to the phenomenon of feature superposition in neural networks. This theory suggests that higher degrees of superposition correlate with increased susceptibility to attacks, explaining the observed robustness-accuracy trade-off <d-cite key="tsipras_robustness_2019"></d-cite>. Recent work by <d-cite key="bloom_features_2023"></d-cite> extends this concept to more complex architectures, uncovering both isotropic and anisotropic superposition in grid world decision transformers.

**Boundary tilting hypothesis.** <d-cite key="gilmer_adversarial_2018"></d-cite> take a geometric perspective, proposing that adversarial examples arise from the high-dimensional nature of data manifolds. This theory suggests that adversarial vulnerability might be an inherent property of high-dimensional classification tasks, explaining the existence of adversarial examples even in simple, linear classifiers.

**Insufficient regularization hypothesis.** Some researchers argue that insufficient regularization during training is the root cause of adversarial vulnerability <d-cite key="goodfellow_explaining_2015,madry_deep_2019"></d-cite>. This view is supported by the success of adversarial training in improving robustness <d-cite key="liu_adversarial_2020"></d-cite>. Recent work has proposed refined methods to address the robustness-accuracy trade-off <d-cite key="wang_improving_2020,cheng_cat_2020,altinisik_a3t_2023"></d-cite>, though the relationship between standard regularization and adversarial robustness remains unclear.

**Neural tangent kernel perspective.** A more recent perspective, based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) <d-cite key="tsilivis_what_2022"></d-cite>, connects adversarial vulnerability to the properties of the NTK. This theory suggests that adversarial examples exploit features corresponding to the largest NTK eigenvalues, which are learned early in training but may not align with human-interpretable features.

These theories, while distinct, are not mutually exclusive. The non-robust features and superposition hypotheses both highlight the importance of feature representations in adversarial vulnerability, albeit from different angles. The boundary tilting and NTK perspectives offer complementary geometric and analytical frameworks for understanding the phenomenon. The insufficient regularization hypothesis, meanwhile, focuses on the training process itself, potentially encompassing aspects of the other theories.

From an interpretability standpoint, each theory suggests different approaches. The non-robust features hypothesis calls for methods to identify and visualize these features. Understanding superposition could lead to more interpretable and robust models. The boundary tilting and NTK perspectives highlight the need for techniques to visualize and analyze high-dimensional decision boundaries and kernel properties. Finally, the regularization perspective suggests that improving interpretability might itself serve as a form of regularization, potentially enhancing robustness.

As the field progresses, a unified theory that integrates these perspectives remains a key goal. Such a theory would need to account for architectural differences in robustness <d-cite key="huang_revisiting_2023"></d-cite>, extend to domains beyond image classification <d-cite key="shayegani_survey_2023"></d-cite>, and scale to large language models <d-cite key="maloyan_trojan_2024"></d-cite>. Moreover, aligning these theories with human perception and reasoning <d-cite key="casper_engineer_2023,zimmermann_scale_2023"></d-cite> presents an ongoing challenge in the pursuit of truly robust and interpretable AI systems.

### Connections between Robustness and Interpretability

Recent research reveals a deep connection between adversarial robustness and model interpretability <d-cite key="casper_engineer_2023,rauker_transparent_2023"></d-cite>:

**Interpretability Enhancing Robustness.** Techniques that improve model interpretability often lead to increased adversarial robustness. A key example is input gradient regularization, which has been shown to simultaneously improve the interpretability of saliency maps and enhance adversarial robustness <d-cite key="ross_improving_2017,du_fighting_2021,boopathy_proper_2020,etmann_connection_2019,kaur_are_2019,kim_bridging_2019,mangla_saliency_2020,sarkar_get_2021"></d-cite>. Additionally, techniques like lateral inhibition <d-cite key="eigen_topkconv_2021"></d-cite> and second-order optimization <d-cite key="tsiligkaridis_second_2020"></d-cite> have been found to improve both interpretability and robustness concurrently.

**Robustness Improving Interpretability.** Conversely, methods designed to improve adversarial robustness often lead to more interpretable models. <d-cite key="engstrom_adversarial_2019"></d-cite> demonstrated that adversarially trained classifiers exhibit improved interpretability-related properties, including more human-aligned feature visualizations. <d-cite key="salman_adversarially_2020"></d-cite> showed that robust models produce better representations for transfer learning tasks. Furthermore, adversarially trained networks yield improved representations for image generation <d-cite key="santurkar_image_2019"></d-cite> and modeling the human visual system <d-cite key="engstrom_adversarial_2019"></d-cite>, suggesting that robustness leads to simpler, more interpretable internal representations.

**Designing Adversaries via Interpretability Tools.** Interpretability techniques can be leveraged to design more effective adversarial attacks, which in turn can be used to validate interpretability methods. <d-cite key="carter_activation_2019"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="casper_robust_2021"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="mu_compositional_2020"></d-cite>, and <d-cite key="ilyas_adversarial_2019"></d-cite> have demonstrated how interpretability insights can guide the creation of targeted adversarial examples. This approach not only helps in understanding model vulnerabilities but also serves as a rigorous way to demonstrate the usefulness of interpretability tools.

**Adversarial Examples Aiding Interpretability.** Adversarial examples themselves can serve as powerful tools for model interpretation. They have been particularly useful in trojan detection methods <d-cite key="guo_tabor_2019,liu_adversarial_2020,zheng_topological_2021,wang_survey_2022"></d-cite>. Beyond trojan detection, adversarial examples can reveal important features and decision boundaries in neural networks <d-cite key="dong_interpretable_2019,tomsett_why_2018,wang_neural_2019"></d-cite>, enhancing our mechanistic understanding of model behavior.

These interconnections between robustness and interpretability -- while the *underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood* -- suggest that advances in one area could benefit the other, potentially leading to AI systems that are both more secure *and* more transparent.

### Fundamentals of Mechanistic Interpretability

Mechanistic interpretability <d-cite key="bereska_mechanistic_2024"></d-cite> aims to reverse-engineer the computational mechanisms of neural networks, providing a granular, causal understanding of AI decision-making <d-cite key="olah_zoom_2020,nanda_comprehensive_2022"></d-cite>. This approach treats neural networks as computational graphs, uncovering *circuits* responsible for specific behaviors <d-cite key="wang_interpretability_2023"></d-cite>. It offers a promising path to address the challenges identified in adversarial vulnerability theories and bridge the gap between robustness and interpretability.

Core concepts include *features* as fundamental units of representation, *circuits* as computational primitives, and *motifs* as universal patterns across models/tasks <d-cite key="olah_zoom_2020,cammarata_curve_2020,olsson_incontext_2022"></d-cite>. These concepts provide a framework for understanding how models process information and make decisions, potentially explaining what decides if a neural network mechanism is robust or vulnerable. For a visual explanation of the core concepts, refer to <d-cite key="bereska_mechanistic_2024"></d-cite>. 

Key techniques span observational and interventional methods. Observational approaches include (structured) probing <d-cite key="belinkov_probing_2021,burns_discovering_2023"></d-cite>, the logit lens <d-cite key="nostalgebraist_interpreting_2020"></d-cite>, and sparse autoencoders <d-cite key="cunningham_sparse_2024,bricken_monosemanticity_2023,templeton_scaling_2024"></d-cite>. Interventional methods, such as activation patching (also called causal tracing <d-cite key="meng_locating_2022"></d-cite> or interchange interventions <d-cite key="geiger_inducing_2021"></d-cite>), allow for direct manipulation of model internals. These techniques can be used to study how adversarial examples affect model behavior at a mechanistic level. Furthermore, circuit analysis techniques <d-cite key="wang_interpretability_2023,wu_interpretability_2023,conmy_automated_2023"></d-cite> to localize and understand subgraphs responsible for specific behaviors can be partially automated <d-cite key="conmy_automated_2023,syed_attribution_2023,bills_language_2023,marks_sparse_2024,bushnaq_local_2024"></d-cite>. Causal abstraction <d-cite key="geiger_causal_2023"></d-cite> and causal scrubbing <d-cite key="chan_causal_2022"></d-cite> provide rigorous frameworks for hypothesis testing, potentially offering new ways to validate theories of adversarial vulnerability. 

Mechanistic interpretability has achieved notable successes, including the identification of specific circuits in vision and language models <d-cite key="cammarata_curve_2020,olsson_incontext_2022"></d-cite>, the discovery of universal motifs across different architectures <d-cite key="olsson_incontext_2022,olah_zoom_2020,chughtai_toy_2023"></d-cite>, and the development of techniques for targeted interventions in model behavior <d-cite key="meng_massediting_2022"></d-cite>. However, as a young and pre-paradigmatic field, significant challenges remain. Scalability issues persist when applying current techniques to larger models <d-cite key="rauker_transparent_2023,lieberum_does_2023"></d-cite>, and achieving a comprehensive understanding of complex neural networks remains elusive <d-cite key="tegmark_provably_2023"></d-cite>. The reliability of mechanistic insights is further challenged by the potential for interpretability illusions <d-cite key="bolukbasi_interpretability_2021"></d-cite> and the complex dynamics of models embedded in rich, interactive environments <d-cite key="leahy_barriers_2023"></d-cite>. These environmental interactions introduce two critical challenges: externally, models may adapt to and reshape their environments through in-context learning <d-cite key="vonoswald_uncovering_2023"></d-cite>, and internally, they may exhibit the *hydra effect*, flexibly reorganizing their representations to maintain capabilities even after circuit ablations <d-cite key="mcgrath_hydra_2023"></d-cite>.

Despite these limitations, mechanistic interpretability offers a powerful toolkit for exploring the intersection of adversarial robustness and model interpretability. Providing a causal understanding of model behavior may help reconcile the seemingly contradictory theories of adversarial vulnerability. For a detailed review of the field, refer to <d-cite key="bereska_mechanistic_2024"></d-cite>.

### Open Questions and Future Directions

The intersection of adversarial robustness and mechanistic interpretability presents several critical challenges and opportunities for future research. 

**Joint Challenges.**
1. Both fields ultimately aim to align model behavior with human expectations, albeit through different approaches. Mechanistic interpretability aims to identify circuits corresponding to human-understandable concepts. Similarly, adversarial robustness makes models robust to perturbations that humans would consider insignificant. Developing human-aligned evaluation metrics for both interpretability and robustness remains a challenge <d-cite key="casper_engineer_2023"></d-cite>. 
   - How can we define and measure "human-aligned robustness" beyond simple $l_p$-norm constraints? 
   - Can mechanistic interpretability help us understand why certain perturbations are perceived as adversarial by humans while others are not?
2. Both fields grapple with scaling to larger models. Mechanistic interpretability techniques could potentially be used to detect and understand trojans or backdoors in large language models, a form of adversarial vulnerability <d-cite key="maloyan_trojan_2024"></d-cite>. Understanding how concepts like adversarial examples and robustness translate to large language models is an active area of research <d-cite key="shayegani_survey_2023"></d-cite>. 
   - How do the relationships between interpretability and robustness scale to large language models? 
   - Can mechanistic interpretability techniques help us understand and mitigate vulnerabilities in large language models, such as prompt injection attacks?

**Understanding.** Can we develop a unified theoretical framework that explains the observed connections between the robustness and interpretability of neural networks? 
   - a) How can we reconcile theories of non-robust features <d-cite key="ilyas_adversarial_2019"></d-cite>, superposition <d-cite key="elhage_toy_2022"></d-cite>, and boundary tilting <d-cite key="gilmer_adversarial_2018"></d-cite> into a cohesive explanation of adversarial vulnerability?
   - b) What is the causal relationship between robustness and interpretability? Does one directly lead to the other, or is there a common underlying factor? Can we quantify the degree of interpretability improvement in robust models across different architectures and tasks?
   - c) How does feature representation, particularly superposition, relate to adversarial vulnerability and interpretability? How can we measure and control the degree of superposition in large-scale models to improve both interpretability and robustness? Is there a fundamental trade-off between representational capacity (enabled by superposition) and robustness?
   - d) Can mechanistic interpretability help us understand why certain perturbations are perceived as adversarial by humans while others are not?

**Engineering.** Can insights from mechanistic interpretability be leveraged to design inherently more robust architectures or training procedures? And vice versa, how can we use adversarial examples to aid mechanistic interpretability? 
   - a) Can we use mechanistic interpretability to predict which model components will most likely be exploited by adversarial attacks? How can we leverage insights about model circuits to design training procedures or architectures that are inherently more robust?
   - b) How can we systematically use adversarial examples to probe and understand the decision-making processes of complex models? Can we develop adversarial attacks targeting hypothesized computational circuits within models <d-cite key="bloom_features_2023"></d-cite>?
   - c) Can mechanistic interpretability insights help us understand and mitigate other types of vulnerabilities in AI systems, such as backdoors or trojans <d-cite key="maloyan_trojan_2024"></d-cite>?

Priority should be given to *understanding* mechanisms first, followed by *improving* robustness and interpretability on benchmarks second.

## Potential Impacts and Ethical Considerations

This research promises several benefits: enhanced AI safety through vulnerability detection <d-cite key="garcia-carrasco_detecting_2024"></d-cite>, increased model transparency fostering trust and regulatory compliance <d-cite key="doshi-velez_rigorous_2017"></d-cite>, improved robustness against distribution shifts and adversarial attacks <d-cite key="augustin_adversarial_2020"></d-cite>, and theoretical insights into neural network behavior <d-cite key="elhage_toy_2022,ilyas_adversarial_2019"></d-cite>.

However, it also poses risks: dual-use potential for creating sophisticated attacks <d-cite key="casper_red_2023"></d-cite>, unintended AI capability amplification <d-cite key="soares_if_2023"></d-cite>, "interpretability illusions" leading to false sense of security <d-cite key="bolukbasi_interpretability_2021"></d-cite>, and privacy concerns from model information extraction <d-cite key="shokri_membership_2017,carlini_extracting_2021"></d-cite>, adversarially validate interpretability methods <d-cite key="nanfack_adversarial_2024"></d-cite>, and potentially explore privacy-preserving techniques <d-cite key="papernot_science_2016"></d-cite>. 

To mitigate these risks, we will ethically review all experiments, if necessary, collaborate with AI ethics and security experts, establish responsible vulnerability disclosure protocols, and prioritize defensive techniques over offensive capabilities. Moreover, we will engage regularly with the AI safety community to discuss information hazards. 

These measures aim to maximize research benefits while minimizing potential harm to AI safety and ethics.

## Conclusion

This project aims to advance AI safety by exploring the synergy between mechanistic interpretability and adversarial robustness. Our interdisciplinary approach combines insights from both fields to develop more transparent, reliable, and human-aligned AI systems. By addressing key challenges in understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities, we hope to contribute significantly to the responsible development and deployment of AI in high-stakes applications and help ensure humanity's survival and prosperity in the face of superhuman AI.

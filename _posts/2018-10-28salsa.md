# Salsa
Dancing Salsa can be a lot of fun. That is what I was told. However, as a beginner you can also have a hard time. Especially as the leading partner. When leading, you are largely responsible for designing the dance. Naturally, as you start, you have a very limited knowledge of figures and moves, which can be quite frustrating.
In a typical social dancing situation, you might feel overwhelmed with doing everything at once: Leading the following partner, keeping the rhythm, keeping eye contact and at the same time looking as if you enjoy all of that (e.g. by keeping up a smile). Under this computational cost I quickly discovered the bottleneck in me: it happened all the time, that I knew, I should be able to recall some move pattern, but for whatever reason my memory denied me access to it. The default advice, that gets thrown at you from every source you consult, is *practice, practice and practice ...*

This leaves you wondering, if there is something smarter and more effective than learning through practice? Yes, there is. There is one simple hack to memory, that is known in human civilization for at least a couple of millenia. That is, **writing things down**. 

But how to write down a dance pattern? English, or natural human languages for that matter, are highly adapted to communicating ideas and thoughts, but cumbersome for describing a delicate physical movement without being too wordy. Videos help. And I can recommend  watching YouTube (some links at the [end](#youtube)) or filming yourself, but if you just want to a quick reference to a move or want to start seeing the commonalities and correspondences across sequences more clearly, you may want a representation that is both more customizable and explicit, such as a **Salsa Language**.   

A code for Salsa should (like any code) make use of the underlying patterns of what it represents. A concise model of Salsa is a given by a **Hidden Markov Model** (HMM) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)). This models a dance as a sequence of states $s$ that are linked by certain state transitions, induced by actions $a$. As a lead, if you know what actions are possible from what state, you may combine and create your own dance patterns. Learning salsa patterns now (in theory) simplifies to learning state-action pairs $(s, a)$. 

Initially, I searched the internet for an existing codification of Salsa and found a nice source in [salsaisgood.com](http://www.salsaisgood.com/dictionary/Salsa_language.htm). They describe each tact in the music in five lines of symbols for hand hold, direction, lead, common action, follow. Starting from their ideas, I tried to simplify and streamline, which I will present in the following:

## Salsa Language
Salsa consists of states $s$ and actions $a$. The actions can induce state transitions. Any finite dance pattern can then be represented by a sequence of state-action pairs.
> $(s_1, a_1)$    $\rightarrow$ $\ldots$   $\rightarrow$ $(s_N, a_N)$

For clarity I will refer to the lead with masculine gender and to the follow with a female gender in the following.



|States| Name | Depiction|
|---------|--|--|
|      0   | normal no hands |  
|      N   | normal hold hands |
|      C   | normal closed | 
|     X   | normal crossed hands |
|     SM   | sombrero |
|     HL   | hammerlock |
|     KL   | cuddle lock |
|     TT   | titanic |

The basic actions are:

 
|Actions| Name | Variations
|---------|--|--
|      p   | push her | 
|      @   | turn her |
|      e   | comb her |em : self-comb (m for lead)
| xbl |  cross body lead
 |xh | switch hands 
| ? | walk around her |?b walk in circle around each other
 | d | dip her
 | $|  snake up 
 | ! | stop her in motion 
 
 |Specifiers| Name | Variations
|---------|--|--
 | <<, ><, >>, <> |directions  
 | °°, .., °., .° |hand positions 
 | & |style improvisation


|Turns | |
|---------|--|--
|@b |both partners turn
@m|  lead turns
 @@ |double turn 
 @/2| half turn 
 @h |turn her at head 
 @i |turn her inwards |
 @o| turn her outwards 

A state or an action can be supplemented with additional information. One such information is the hand position another is the direction the partners are facing towards.

| Directions | Explanation
|--|---
| <> |face-to-face
| >< |back-to-back
| << | she stands behind him
| >> | he stands behind her

| Hands | Explanation
|--|---
| °° |both hands up
| .. | both hands down
| °. | left hand up, right down
| .° | left hand up, right down

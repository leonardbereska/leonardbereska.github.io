## What is a Language?

Symbols, formal systems in general
connected or designed to convey meaning.

What is information?
Isomorphisms. Language is constructed as an isomorphism to reality (the subjective reality of the speaker). This is what makes it informative.
Compression
Context and a smart decoder as a means to further compress.


## Hidden Markov Models
States, actions, state transitions.


## The Salsa Language
Should be:
- intuitive, simple
- expressive
- aid learning
-

My problem: remember figures in the heat of the dance.
Solution: memorize state and transitions by heart.

# States
0 normal no hands
N normal both hands,
S to side
C closed position CC very close
X normal cross hands
SM sombrero
HL hammerlock
KL cuddle lock
TT titanic: same as N<< but move to side


# Actions
p push
@ turn, @b both turn, @m man turns, @@ double turn @/2 half turn @h turn her at head
@i turn in @o turn out (local female coordinate system)
e comb em comb self
xbl cross body lead
xh change hands xh° change hand from above to below (behind back)
? walk around her ?b walk in circle around each other
d dip
$ snake up
\# stop in motion and bounce back #s stop at shoulder
..h°° hands over her head
& style improvisation

# Specifiers (for disambiguiation, if needed)
state specifier <> face-to-face << lead behind >> follow behind >< back-to-back  >><< ass-to-ass
hands as state/action specifier: e.g. °N., °HL., °p, e°# Actions

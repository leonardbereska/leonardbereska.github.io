I am Leonard Friedrich Bereska, a PhD Candidate in AI Safety at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research focuses on Mechanistic Interpretability, aiming to enhance AI safety by making transformer models more transparent and understandable. My work involves reverse engineering neural networks into human-interpretable algorithms, which aims to contribute to the broader goal of AI safety.

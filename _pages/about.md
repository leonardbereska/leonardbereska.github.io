I'm Leonard, a PhD Candidate at the University of Amsterdam, dedicated to enhancing AI safety through mechanistic interpretability. My research aims to make transformer models more transparent and understandable, contributing to the broader goal of AI alignment.

### research focus

My work revolves around reverse engineering neural networks into human-interpretable algorithms. I'm particularly interested in:

- Developing techniques to reduce polysemanticity in transformer models.
- Exploring the emergence of world models in large language models.
- Investigating the connections between superposition and disentanglement.
- Applying mechanistic interpretability insights to real-world AI safety challenges or medical applications.

As part of the [AI Safety Initiative Amsterdam](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/), I'm actively involved in promoting AI safety research and awareness. We organize events, facilitate reading groups, and foster discussions on crucial AI safety topics.

I'm also passionate about nurturing the next generation of AI safety researchers. I've been involved in teaching courses and supervising numerous Master's students on projects ranging from detecting bias, eliciting truth in LLMs, to interpretability in medical AI applications.

### beyond research

When I'm not diving into the intricacies of neural networks, you might find me:

- Practicing yoga or meditation to maintain balance.
- Reading science-fiction novels (recently discovered Vernor Vinge's work for a plausible treatment of AI singularity).
- Playing with my two chihuahuas, Cicchetti and Pancetta. 
- Exploring Amsterdam's culinary scene (always on the lookout for the best vegan spots!)
- Brushing up on my Mandarin or picking up Dutch phrases.
- Engaging in discussions about the future of AI and its implications for society.

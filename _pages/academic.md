## talks, presentations and figures

I have given several talks on AI Safety and Mechanistic Interpretability:

- The AI Alignment Problem ([slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2023_alignment_problem_soos.pdf)) ([keynote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GnxoDtuJKaIyLu3gyp36kgc_rsc4p7KE/view?usp=sharing)) (March, 2023, University of Amsterdam)
- Taming Simulators ([slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2023_taming_simulators_aaai.pdf)) ([keynote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znJ_tRyToofbyOXAr49TXagzdOOESAqf/view?usp=sharing)) (June, 2023, AAAI Symposium, Singapore)
- AI Safety for LLMs ([slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2023_aisafety_ellis.pdf)) ([keynote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1N0NqI5FJiTtat2nGbkz9DhEEe6bAXW/view?usp=sharing)) (Nov. 2023, Keynote ELLIS BeNeLux, Delft)
- Mechanistic Interpretability [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G0CFf_jJJlnDDLNfIvv8G4HdC4V6Sn9b8La13_sJ5wE/edit?usp=sharing) (May 2024, University of Amsterdam)

I have also created figures for research papers in keynote:

- [Mechanistic Interpretability for AI Safety — A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14082) ([keynote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V1HqBGXX31Ls7egwVJpSrrUpFpd4lZgH/view?usp=sharing))

## teaching 

I have been involved in teaching several courses for the Master's programs in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. Below is a brief description of each.

##### deep learning I & II (teaching assistant: WS 21/22, WS 22/23, SS 22, SS 23)

These courses cover the fundamentals and advanced topics in deep learning. 
For [deep learning I](https://uvadlc.github.io/), I was responsible for the topics: recurrent neural networks, dynamical systems, energy-based models, and graph neural networks.
For [deep learning II](https://uvadl2c.github.io/), I supervised student projects on bayesian deep learning, and reward hacking in reinforcement learning. 

##### foundation models (lecturer)

In this course, I co-lectured a section on AI safety for large language models, covering:
- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) prepared by Leon Lang,
- developmental interpretability prepared by Tim Bakker,
- mechanistic interpretability prepared by me.
Our lecture slides are available under this [link to google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpSZ8cRbh5R7_UEIXyoiikm-Q18b2yzRSyO6CpeY_fQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## conferences

- Reviewer for NeurIPS 2023, CVPR 2022, CVPR 2021, ICCV.
- Presented work at [CoLLAs 2022](https://lifelong-ml.cc/Conferences/2022) and [AAAI Summer Symposium 2023](https://aaai.org/conference/summer-symposia/summer-series-2023/).

## summer schools and courses 

I have participated in several summer schools and workshops to enhance my knowledge in AI and AI Safety:

## extracurricular 

As co-founder and part of the core team of the [AI Safety Initiative Amsterdam](https://aisafetyamsterdam.com/), I have been involved in organizing various events:

- _OpenAI Talk and Q&A_ on AI and Existential Risk (I managed the local Amsterdam event) (September 2023),
- _Panel Discussion on AI Risks: From Today to Doomsday_ ([slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2023_panel_discussion_uva.pdf)) (October 2023),
- Reading groups on [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) (Jan. - March 2024).
